# Financial Performance Analysis of Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple (2021-2023)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This analysis provides a comprehensive review of key financial metrics for Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple over three fiscal years—2021, 2022, and 2023. The data includes total revenue, net income, total assets, total liabilities, and cash flow from operations. Year-over-year growth percentages for revenue and net income are also evaluated to assess the financial health and operational efficiency of each company.

## Analysis by Metric:

**Total Revenue**: This metric represents the total amount of income generated from the company's business activities before any costs or expenses are subtracted. A positive growth percentage indicates an increase in revenue from the previous year, reflecting business expansion or increased sales efficiency.

**Net Income**: Represents the total earnings of the company after all expenses have been deducted from total revenue. It's a key indicator of the company's profitability. Changes in net income can result from alterations in revenue, cost management, or both.

**Total Assets**: This is the sum of all assets owned by the company, reflecting its economic resources. Changes in total assets can indicate new investments, asset acquisitions, or shifts in company strategy.

**Total Liabilities**: Represents all financial obligations. An increase can suggest new debt or higher operational liabilities, while a decrease could indicate debt repayment or better liability management.

**CF Operating (Cash Flow from Operations)**: Measures the cash generated from normal business operations, reflecting the company's ability to generate sufficient cash to maintain and grow operations.

## Key Findings:

Tesla demonstrated robust revenue growth, peaking at 51.36% in 2022, indicating aggressive market expansion and increased sales volume.

Apple displayed steady growth in 2022 but faced a slight revenue decline in 2023 by -2.80%, possibly due to market saturation or competitive pressures.

Microsoft maintained a positive trajectory in net income growth until 2023, where a slight decline of -0.52% was observed, suggesting potential increases in operational costs or investment in growth initiatives.
Apple experienced minimal fluctuations in net income, with a modest increase followed by a decrease in 2023, mirroring its revenue trends and possibly indicating stable but challenged profit margins.

### Asset and Liability Management:

All companies increased their asset bases over the period, with Microsoft showing the most significant rise, enhancing its strategic asset accumulation.
